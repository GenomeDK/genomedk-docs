# Study description

Whole-genome DNA sequencing data generated from tumor samples from 11 hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) patients, 15 hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) patients, and 5 castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. The tumor samples were either acquired as fresh-frozen radical prostatectomy tissue or fresh-frozen transurethral resection of the prostate tissue. The dataset includes the BAM files for the 31 patients (tumor + germline).

# Data access
External researchers (academic or commercial) interested in analysing the prostate dataset will need to contact the Data Access Committee via email to kdso@clin.au.dk. The Data Access Committee is formed of Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen, Michael Borre, and Ole Halfdan Larsen (Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University). Due to Danish Law, for the authors to be allowed to share the data (pseudonymised) it will require prior approval from The Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics (or similar) for the specific new research goal. The author (based in Denmark) has to submit the application for ethical approval, with the external researcher(s) as named collaborator(s). In addition to ethical approval, a Collaboration Agreement and a Data Processing Agreement is required, both of which must be approved by the legal office of the institution of the author (data owner) and the legal office of the institution of the external researcher (data processor).
