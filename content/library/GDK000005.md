# Study description
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data was generated from tumor DNA (DatasetID A) and paired normal DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (DatasetID B) from 144 patients with stage III colorectal cancer (CRC). This included two patients with synchronous tumors (n = 2), resulting in a total of 146 tumor biopsies. Tumor samples were either acquired as fresh-frozen (n = 111) or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (n = 35) tissue biopsies. Furthermore, WGS data was generated for plasma-derived cell-free DNA (DatasetID C) from 1283 serially collected plasma samples from the 144 stage III CRC patients.

# Data access

External researchers (academic or commercial) interested in analysing the colorectal cancer dataset will need to contact the Data Access Committee via email to cla@clin.au.dk. The Data Access Committee is formed of Claus Lindbjerg Andersen, Mads Heilskov Rasmussen, and Ole Halfdan Larsen (Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University). Due to Danish Law, for the authors to be allowed to share the data (pseudonymized) it will require prior approval from The Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics (or similar) for the specific new research goal. The author (based in Denmark) must submit the application for ethical approval, with the external researcher(s) as named collaborator(s). In addition to ethical approval, a Collaboration Agreement and a Data Processing Agreement is required, both of which must be approved by the legal office of the institution of the author (data owner) and the legal office of the institution of the external researcher (data processor).
