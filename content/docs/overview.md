It's time to get your feet wet and learn how to use GenomeDK! The
documentation is organized such that it can be used in two ways:

-   You can read it from beginning to end like a *book* to familiarize
    yourself with GenomeDK and learn how to do basic things like
    submitting a job and working with projects.
-   You can use it as a *reference* to look up the solution for specific
    questions you may have, such as what is the command for requesting a
    new project folder? Or, how do I get passwordless authentication
    working?

If you're new to GenomeDK you will most likely want to read the
documentation *as a book*. As you become more experienced you will more
often use it as a *reference*.
