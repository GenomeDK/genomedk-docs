# Billing model

If the project owner is affiliated with one of the following organisations:

* Faculty of Health, Aarhus University,
* Faculty of Natural Sciences, Aarhus University,
* Central Denmark Region (Region Midt),

usage is covered through internal funding, and no direct invoice is issued to the project owner.

DeIC projects are only billed if they exceed the resources covered by the DeIC grant.

# When am I billed?

We have previously sent out bills in January and will also do so for 2025 usage. In the future we will send out bills in December.
