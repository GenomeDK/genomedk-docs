We hope you’ve had a good summer break. As we return to our regular routines, we’d like to share a few important updates and announcements from GenomeDK:

* HPC review process at AU: we need your support!
* 10 PB storage expansion now in production and available to all users.
* All DeIC projects GenomeDK end on April 1, 2026.

Thank you for being part of the GenomeDK community!

Best regards,

_The GenomeDK Team_

## HPC review at Aarhus University – we need your support

Aarhus University is currently conducting an internal process to clarify the future need for high-performance computing (HPC) across its research communities, including the role of local HPC facilities like GenomeDK.

This process will help determine where future HPC funding should be directed, and user feedback will play an important role.

Most likely, you will be contacted by your faculty/institute to take part in the process. **If you do not hear from your faculty/institute before September 21st, we strongly encourage you to contact your local institute or faculty leadership** to let them know how important GenomeDK is to your work, research collaborations, teaching, and future research.

Your voice truly matters, whether you are a student, PhD, post doc, or VIP --- thank you for helping us advocate for the infrastructure that supports your science.

## 10 PB storage expansion completed

We’ve expanded our infrastructure with an additional **10 petabytes (PB)** of storage, bringing our **total capacity to 33 PB**. This upgrade ensures better performance and more room for large-scale genomic data projects. The new storage is now live and available to users.

{% warning() %}
While we are happy to store your data, please remember to (1) clean up your projects regularly to remove temporary files, and (2) compress data where it makes sense to save space, especially for long-term storage.
{% end %}

**Fun fact:** Our primary storage system (*faststorage*) now consists of 2060 hard drives --- and our in-house backup system adds another 980 drives to the mix!

## DeIC funding ending April 2026

As previously announced, funding from **DeIC (Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation)** will end on **April 1, 2026**. DeIC is a national organization under the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science responsible for coordinating and supporting research infrastructure, including data storage, computing, and networking for the Danish universities.

GenomeDK has been part of the DeIC High-Throughput Computing Consortium, which supports large-scale, compute-intensive projects across the Danish universities.

With this funding ending, DeIC-supported projects (projects with a name prefixed with `DeIC-`) on GenomeDK will be charged for their resource usage from **April 1, 2026 and onwards** if they choose to continue the projects on GenomeDK.

We are working to ensure a smooth transition and will contact affected projects owners with further details in the coming months.

## Share your use case – help us promote your work

We’re always looking to **highlight the diverse and impactful research** done on GenomeDK. If you have a project or use case you'd like to share, please get in touch! These stories help us communicate the platform’s value to funders, collaborators, and new users.

Our most recent featured use case is [Transforming the NGS Summer School with the GenomeDK Desktop](https://genome.au.dk/news/ngs-course-use-case/) by Samuele Saroggi, showcasing Samuele's use of GenomeDK's infrastructure for the "Introduction to NGS Data Analysis" summer school.

Contact us at [support@genome.au.dk](mailto:support@genome.au.dk) to share your story or learn more.

## New privacy policy available

GenomeDK now has a dedicated [privacy policy](@/privacy.md) outlining how we handle and protect user data. We encourage all users to review the policy, available on our website, to stay informed about data governance and user rights.
