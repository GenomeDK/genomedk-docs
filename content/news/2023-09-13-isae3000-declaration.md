> "The description fairly presents how IT general controls in relation to Aarhus Genome Data Centerâ€™s GenomeDK HPC services were designed and implemented throughout the period from 1 September 2022 to 31 August 2023;"

These are the words from our independent, external auditor following this year's audit. We are happy to say that GenomeDK passed the audit with flying colors and have now, for the third year in a row, obtained a ISAE 3000 declaration with a focus on ISO 27001.

What does this mean? It means that the auditor has found that our policies, procedures, and controls with regards to information security have been found suitable *and* adequate by the auditor.

The ISAE 3000 declaration, supplemented by our ISO 27001 certification, highlights how seriously we take security.
