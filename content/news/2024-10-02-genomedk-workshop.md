The team of the [Accessible Bioinformatics Cafe](https://abc.au.dk) and the GenomeDK team invites you to the workshop "Use GenomeDK".

* **Date and time:** Thursday, October 10th, 11:00-15:00
* **Location:** Building 1540, room K26.

We will cover the following topics:

* Login and public-key authentication
* File systems
* Basic commands
* Project management
* File transfers and downloading data
* Software installation and management

There will be a break for questions and lunch (not included) at 12, and again more time for questions and problem solving during the workshop. The only prerequisite is to have a working account on GenomeDK and a laptop - any extra knowledge is of course welcomed.
