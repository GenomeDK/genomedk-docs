The first series of workshops was a great success, so we're doing another round!

Are you a student or academic, current or future user of the GenomeDK high-performance computing (HPC) system? Or are you just curious about HPC and how you can utilize it in your work? Do you need to learn to use GenomeDK, or wish to become a better and more organized user?

Then join us in this series of GenomeDK workshops where we guide you from a general introduction to advanced usage. Each workshop targets increasing difficulty levels, so you can join the sessions that fit you best.

<!-- more -->

Each workshop is scheduled for four hours, including a 45 min. lunch break.

There will be cake, coffee, and tea for attendants, so please remember to sign
up **no later than 3 days** before the workshop. Workshops with less than 10
sign-ups will be cancelled.

{% note() %}
Please help us circulate the workshop invitations to any relevant departments/groups, thanks!
