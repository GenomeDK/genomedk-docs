It's 2023 and we finally have a news section. The news section will be a mix of announcements, newsletters, press releases, technical posts, and short updates. Downtimes will still only be announced on the [status page](https://console.genome.au.dk/status) and via e-mail.

Previous newsletters have been added to this section already, so if you want you can take a trip down memory lane.

Stay tuned, we'll have plenty of news this year!
