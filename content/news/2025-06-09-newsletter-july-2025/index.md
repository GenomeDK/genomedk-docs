As summer settles in, we’d like to share a few important updates and announcements from the GenomeDK platform, including:

* HPC review process at AU: we need your support!
* 10 PB storage expansion now in production and available to all users.
* All DeIC projects GenomeDK end on April 1, 2024.
* GenomeDK and DST collaborating to enable researchers to access DST data on GenomeDK.

Thank you for being part of the GenomeDK community. We wish you a great summer!

Best regards,

_The GenomeDK Team_

## HPC review at Aarhus University – we need your support

Aarhus University is currently conducting an internal process to clarify the future need for high-performance computing (HPC) across its research communities, including the role of local HPC facilities like GenomeDK.

This process will help determine where future HPC funding should be directed, and user feedback will play an important role. If GenomeDK is critical to your research, **we strongly encourage you to contact your local institute or faculty leadership** to let them know how important GenomeDK is to your work, research collaborations, and future research.

Your voice matters --- thank you for helping us advocate for the infrastructure that supports your science.

## 10 PB storage expansion completed

We’ve expanded our infrastructure with an additional **10 petabytes (PB)** of storage, bringing our **total capacity to 33 PB**. This upgrade ensures better performance and more room for large-scale genomic data projects. The new storage is now live and available to users.

**Fun fact:** Our primary storage system (*faststorage*) now consists of 2060 hard drives --- and our in-house backup system adds another **980 drives** to the mix!

## DeIC funding ending April 2026

As previously announced, funding from **DeIC (Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation)** will end on **April 1, 2026**. DeIC is a national organization under the Danish Ministry of Higher Education and Science responsible for coordinating and supporting research infrastructure, including data storage, computing, and networking for the Danish universities.

GenomeDK has been part of the DeIC High-Throughput Computing Consortium, which supports large-scale, compute-intensive projects across the life sciences.

With this funding ending, DeIC-supported projects on GenomeDK will be charged for their resource usage from **April 1, 2026 and onwards**.

We are working to ensure a smooth transition and will contact affected projects owners with further details in the coming months.

## New collaboration with Statistics Denmark – testers welcome

GenomeDK has entered into a new collaboration with DST (Statistics Denmark) to enable integration between our high-performance computing infrastructure and DST's data resources.

We are currently testing this integration and **invite interested users to help us with early testing**. If you’re interested in participating, please contact us at **[support@genome.au.dk](mailto:support@genome.au.dk)**. 

Note that this is still early days and that we can only handle a limited number of test users right now. However, we are very interested in hearing from you if you have an interest in this solution.

## Share your use case – help us promote your work

We’re always looking to **highlight the diverse and impactful research** done on GenomeDK. If you have a project or use case you'd like to share, please get in touch! These stories help us communicate the platform’s value to funders, collaborators, and new users.

Our most recent featured use case is [High‑fidelity simulations of bubble dynamics for maritime drag reduction](https://genome.au.dk/news/bubble-turbulence-use-case/), led by Sina Nozarian, a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical & Production Engineering, Faculty of Technical Sciences at Aarhus University.

The project explores bubble–turbulence interactions and surface effects to reduce drag (and fuel consumption) in maritime vessels.

Contact us at [support@genome.au.dk](mailto:support@genome.au.dk) to share your story or learn more.

## New privacy policy available

GenomeDK now has a dedicated [privacy policy](@/privacy.md) outlining how we handle and protect user data. We encourage all users to review the policy, available on our website, to stay informed about data governance and user rights.
