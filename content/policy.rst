User and storage policy
=======================

All users/project owners must read and accept this policy. Note that failure to
adhere to the policy rules WILL result in data being deleted with no warning.

The intention of the user and storage policy is to reduce the amount of
redundant, temporary, and old data on the cluster by encouraging users to:

1. use project folders for almost everything,
2. request new project folders instead of keeping multiple projects in the same
   project folder, and
3. make it easy to delete temporary files and log files produced by your
   scripts/workflows.

Following our :ref:`best practices <best_practices>` will make it easier for
users to fulfill item 3, while this policy should encourage item 1 and 2.

User policy
===========

* At user creation, only institutional/company e-mail addresses will be
  accepted.
* The user is responsible for informing GenomeDK about changes to the users
  e-mail address. Any loss of data caused by the failure to do so is solely
  the responsibility of the user.

Storage policy
--------------

* Home folders are limited to 100 GB. Project folders have no such limit.
    * Users/home folders will be deleted 3 months after contact to the user is
      lost.
    * We consider contact to the user lost when the user cannot be reached by
      the provided e-mail for 3 months.
    * Ownership of files owned by the user in question in project folders will
      be transferred to the project owner(s).
* Project folders have a default lifespan of 3 years.
    * When the project reaches end-of-life, the project must either be
      extended, archived or deleted.
    * Archiving the project will make it read-only and the data will be stored
      for up to 3 years.
    * If the project is still active at the end-of-life, the project owner may
      apply for an extension of the lifespan by 1 year at a time.
    * The lifetime of a project can be extended at most 3 times.
    * If the project owner chooses not to archive the project, the project
      folder will be deleted on the day that the project lifespan ends.

The storage and user policies above apply to all users and projects of the
GenomeDK cluster unless a formal agreement has been made between the project
owners and the GenomeDK cluster steering committee.
