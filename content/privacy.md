Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your
information in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR).

Our privacy policy relates to our processing of personal data when we
are data controllers. This is the case when we process your information
necessary to providing our services.

# Data controller

# Information we collect

GenomeDK protects and processes users' personal data through strong
security measures including encrypted communication, two-factor
authentication, and ISO 27001-certified information management. We

ensure data integrity and privacy.

We collect and process minimal personal data necessary for providing our
services:​

This information is used solely to manage your account, for billing
purposes, to ensure system security, keep you informed about changes and
improvements to our services, and provide support. We do not collect
sensitive personal data unless explicitly required and consented to.​

We collect personal data directly from you or from a third party such as

some cases for mandatory financial audit.

# Data retention

Your personal data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the
purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. Upon account
termination, your data will be deleted or anonymized within a reasonable
timeframe, unless retention is mandated by legal obligations.​
