A strong protection of user data is crucial to maintain our users' trust in GenomeDK. Therefore, GenomeDK has comprehensive procedures and systems to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our users' data.

Here are some of the things we do:

* We never store confidential information outside our secure perimeters, and we use encrypted channels for all communication in and out of GenomeDK.
* We employ TOTP-based two-factor authentication for all users.
* We continuously update our information security management system according to international best practices, including ISO 27001.
* We ensure that our employees know our rules about data confidentiality and data security. All employees sign a confidentiality agreement and violations will have serious consequences for employment.
* We continuously monitor relevant channels for newly discovered bugs and security holes that may affect GenomeDK's systems and update our systems accordingly.
* We maintain a small attack surface, with only the required software installed on the base system.
