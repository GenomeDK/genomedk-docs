* We employ TOTP-based two-factor authentication for all users.
* We continuously update our information security management system according to international best practices, including ISO 27001.
* We ensure that our employees know our rules about data confidentiality and data security. All employees sign a confidentiality agreement and violations will have serious consequences for employment.
