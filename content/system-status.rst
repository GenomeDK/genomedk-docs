**Update @ 10:51:** We're experiencing problems with storage systems
which are most likely related to the cooling maintenance. To ensure data
safety we have closed access to the cluster for all users.

**Update @ 11:21:** We have been informed that the building maintenance will
take longer than expected. It is now expected we will be able to resume
operations at 15.00. The cluster should be available shortly after.

**Update @ 13:44:** Building maintenance has finished and GenomeDK is now back
up.

    Due to critical building maintenance on 7th of May 8:00-12:00 we have to
    lower the power output to the minimum. Therefore, the downtime procedure
    will be followed. We hope to limit the scope of this downtime to just
    compute nodes, and keep the rest of the cluster fully operational.
