Upcoming maintenances

    The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this timespan. During the
    downtime we will perform NFS storage maintenance as we are working towards
    decommissioning our old NFS storage servers and introducing new servers.
    Over time, this will result in a more stable and responsive environment for
    all GenomeDK users.

.. event:: Building maintenance

    :tags: compute

    Due to critical building maintenance on 7th of May 8:00-12:00 we have to
    lower the power output to the minimum. Therefore, the downtime procedure
    will be followed. We hope to limit the scope of this downtime to only
    compute nodes, and keep the rest of the cluster fully operational.
