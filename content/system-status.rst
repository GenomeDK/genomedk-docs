    The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this timespan. During the
    downtime we will perform NFS storage maintenance as we are working towards
    decommissioning our old NFS storage servers and introducing new servers.
    Over time, this will result in a more stable and responsive environment for
    all GenomeDK users.
