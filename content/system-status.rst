Everything is operational.


Upcoming maintenances
---------------------

2019-05-03 08:00-16:00
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this timespan. During the
downtime we will perform NFS storage maintenance as we are working towards
decommissioning our old NFS storage servers and introducing new servers.
Over time, this will result in a more stable and responsive environment for
all GenomeDK users.
