We are happy to provide on-location workshops on request. Send us an e-mail
with your wishes for the workshop and approximate size of the group. Here are
some possible topics for a workshop:

* you group needs help getting started with GenomeDK,
* you wants to improve the reproducibility of your projects,
* you group wants to use *gwf* for workflows, but need an introduction,
* just want to know if high-performance computing can help you solve your
  problems.
