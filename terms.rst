**Billing.** Costs are associated with project folders. The owner of a project folder is responsible for the costs associated with the project.

If the project owner is associated with either:

* Faculty of Health, Aarhus University,
* Faculty of Natural Sciences, Aarhus University,
* Central Region Denmark (Region Midt),

then the usage is paid internally, and the project owner will not receive a bill directly from GenomeDK.

Otherwise, the project owner will be charged once per year, in January, based on actual usage in the previous year.

**Payment methods.** The project owner will be sent an invoice with information on how to pay.

**Late payment.** The charges may accrue late interest @ 2% of the outstanding balance per week, or the maximum rate permitted by the law, whichever is lower.

**No Refunds.** You may contact us to have your account terminated at any time, but no refunds are issued.

**Changes.** We update the prices on a yearly basis and the new prices will be announced on our website.
