========================================================
GenomeDK, a national high-performance computing facility
========================================================

.. container:: lead

  managed by the Aarhus Genome Data Center at Aarhus University. GenomeDK is for
  any field of research, with a strong track record in bioinformatics and the
  life sciences.

  GenomeDK is ISO 27001-certified and receives yearly ISAE-3000 declarations
  with a focus on GDPR.

GenomeDK comprises 84 nodes (4380 cores) connected with Infiniband. Each
node has from 36 to 64 cores and either 384 GB or 512 GB of RAM for a total of
40 TB of memory. GenomeDK has a fast storage system with a total capacity of 12
PB.

GenomeDK provides **strong security by default**. Our *closed zones* build on
top of this by adding data export mechanisms, isolating computations, and
limiting access to the Internet. You can :ref:`read more here <about_zones>`.

Who can get an account?
=======================

We are open to account requests from people associated with a university
or small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

What does it cost?
==================

In 2023, the prices are:

* 0.13 DKK/billing hour
* 2.34 DKK/GPU hour
* 250 DKK/TB/year
* 500 DKK/TB/year in backup*

One billing hour corresponds to one CPU core for one hour or 8 GB memory for
one hour, whichever is highest. One GPU hour is the same as 18 core hours
(half of the cores of a GPU node).

Prices are updated yearly and are subject to change. Do not hesitate to contact
us if you have any questions.

\* For example, if you store 1 TB of data in backup for a year you will be
billed 250 + 500 DKK. 250 DKK for the on-disk copy and 500 DKK for off-site
backup copy.

How do I pay?
=============

Costs are associated with *project folders*. The owner of a project folder is
responsible for the costs associated with the project. The project owner will
be charged yearly (in January) based on actual usage.

If the project owner is associated with either:

* Faculty of Health, Aarhus University,
* Faculty of Natural Sciences, Aarhus University,
* Central Region Denmark (Region Midt),

then the usage is paid internally and the project owner will not receive a bill
directly from GenomeDK.
