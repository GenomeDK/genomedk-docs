Welcome to GenomeDK!
====================


The GenomeDK HPC cluster at Aarhus University comprises of 215 nodes (4352
cores) connected with 10GigE/Infiniband. Each node has from 16 to
36 cores and either 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, or 1 TB of RAM.

The cluster has been designed specifically for bioinformatic workloads and has
a storage capacity of 6 PB.

If you're new to GenomeDK, please read through the
:ref:`Getting started <getting_started>` chapter. This will help you understand
how the cluster works and how to do common things like submitting jobs and
installing software.

Once you're comfortable with performing routine tasks on the cluster, read
the :ref:`Best practices <best_practices>`, which contains suggestions and
patterns for organizing your projects and keeping your research reproducible.
