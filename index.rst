.. note::

    Our third newsletter is out! :ref:`Read it here <newsletter-2020-summer>`.


**GenomeDK is a national high-performance computing facility for bioinformatics
and life sciences managed by Center for Genome Analysis and Personalized
Medicine, located at Aarhus University, Denmark.**

We know that you're busy so here are some shortcuts:

* :ref:`Request an account <request_access>`
* :ref:`Get started <connecting_to_the_cluster>` using the cluster
* :ref:`Contact us <contact>` if you need help

Give me the numbers
===================

GenomeDK comprises of 185 nodes (6568 cores) connected with Infiniband. Each
node has from 16 to 64 cores and either 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, 512 GB or 1 TB
of RAM for a total of 58 TB of memory.

The cluster has been designed specifically for bioinformatic workloads and has
a storage capacity of 12 PB. Do you want to know :ref:`more <technical>`?

What does it cost?
==================

Our current prices are:

* 0.12 DKK/billing hour
* 250 DKK/TB
* 700 DKK/TB in backup

Prices are update yearly and are subject to change. Do not hesitate to contact
us if you have any questions.

One billing hour corresponds to one CPU core for one hour or 8 GB memory for
one hour, whichever is highest.

Cite us!
========

We provide GenomeDK as a resource to research. If you publish results from
computations performed on GenomeDK, it is important that you acknowledge and/or
cite GenomeDK in your publications. We recommend phrasing it like this:

  *Some/all of the computing for this project was performed on the GenomeDK
  cluster. We would like to thank GenomeDK and Aarhus University for providing
  computational resources and support that contributed to these research
  results.*

We host an incomplete list of :ref:`publications` with data analysis run on
GenomeDK.

Where do I start?
=================

If you're new to GenomeDK, please read through the
:ref:`Getting started <getting_started>` chapter. This will help do common
things like handling data, submitting jobs and installing software, as well as
how to request an account.

Once you're comfortable with performing routine tasks on the cluster, read
the :ref:`Best practices <best_practices>`, which contains suggestions and
patterns for organizing your projects and keeping your research reproducible.

If you want a friendly presentation of how the cluster works, see
:ref:`How does the cluster work? <how_does_the_cluster_work>`.
