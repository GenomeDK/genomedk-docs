    Our newsletter for the summer 2019 is out! :ref:`Read it here <newsletter-2019>`.

**GenomeDK is a national high-performance computing facility for bioinformatics
and life sciences managed by Center for Genome Analysis and Personalized
Medicine, located at Aarhus University, Denmark.**

We know that you're busy so here are some shortcuts:

* :ref:`Request an account <request_access>`
* :ref:`Get started <connecting_to_the_cluster>` using the cluster
* :ref:`Contact us <contact>` if you need help

Give me the numbers
===================

GenomeDK comprises of 124 nodes (2912 cores) connected with Infiniband. Each
node has from 16 to 36 cores and either 128 GB, 256 GB, 384 GB, or 1 TB of RAM.

The cluster has been designed specifically for bioinformatic workloads and has
a storage capacity of 12 PB. Do you want to know :ref:`more <technical>`?

Cite us!
========

We provide GenomeDK as a resource to research. If you publish results from
computations performed on GenomeDK, it is important that you acknowledge and/or
cite GenomeDK in your publications. We recommend phrasing it like this:

  *Some/all of the computing for this project was performed on the GenomeDK
  cluster. We would like to thank GenomeDK and Aarhus University for providing
  computational resources and support that contributed to these research
  results.*

Where do I start?
=================

If you're new to GenomeDK, please read through the
:ref:`Getting started <getting_started>` chapter. This will help do common
things like handling data, submitting jobs and installing software, as well as
how to request an account.

Once you're comfortable with performing routine tasks on the cluster, read
the :ref:`Best practices <best_practices>`, which contains suggestions and
patterns for organizing your projects and keeping your research reproducible.

If you want a friendly presentation of how the cluster works, see
:ref:`How does the cluster work? <how_does_the_cluster_work>`.
