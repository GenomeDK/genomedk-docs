    This maintenance does not involve the cluster itself. No changes or
    upgrades will be performed.

    Due to maintenance of the fire detector and cooling system in the server
    room we need to lower the power output to a minimum. The cluster will not
    be available in any way during this maintenance.


.. event:: Building maintenance

    Due to critical building maintenance on 7th of May 8:00-12:00 we have to
    lower the power output to the minimum. Therefore, the downtime procedure
    will be followed. We hope to limit the scope of this downtime to just
    compute nodes, and keep the rest of the cluster fully operational.


.. event:: NFS storage maintenance
    :uid: nfs-storage-maintenance-20190501
    :start: 2019-05-03 08:00 +0200

    :tags: storage nfs

    The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this timespan. During the
    downtime we will perform NFS storage maintenance as we are working towards
    decommissioning our old NFS storage servers and introducing new servers.
    Over time, this will result in a more stable and responsive environment for
    all GenomeDK users.
