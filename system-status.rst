    The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this timespan. During the
    downtime we will apply system updates across the cluster and perform NFS
    storage maintenance as we are working towards decommissioning our old NFS
    storage servers and introducing new servers. Over time, this will result
    in a more stable and responsive environment for all GenomeDK users.

    :tags: storage hardware

    The cluster will be unavailable for all users in this time span. During the
    downtime we will be applying hardware expansion to our storage. Because the
    expansion involves key infrastructure upgrades, the downtime is needed.
    

.. event:: Faststorage outage
    :uid: faststorage-outage-20190726
    :start: 2019-07-26 01:12 +0200

    :actualend: 2019-07-26 06:05 +0200
    :tags: outage

    Due to unexpected software crash faststorage was unavailable. The problem has been resolved
    and everything should be back up and operational now. 


.. event:: Fire detector and cooling maintenance
    :uid: fire-detector-and-cooling-maintenance-20190522
    :start: 2019-06-12 08:00 +0200

    :tags: building

    This maintenance does not involve the cluster itself. No changes or
    upgrades will be performed.

    Due to maintenance of the fire detector and cooling system in the server
    room we need to lower the power output to a minimum. The cluster will not
    be available in any way during this maintenance.


.. event:: Building maintenance
    :uid: building-maintenance-20190507
    :start: 2019-05-07 08:00 +0200

    :actualend: 2019-05-07 13:44 +0200
    :tags: building

    Due to critical building maintenance on 7th of May 8:00-12:00 we have to
    lower the power output to the minimum. Therefore, the downtime procedure
    will be followed. We hope to limit the scope of this downtime to just
    compute nodes, and keep the rest of the cluster fully operational.


.. event:: NFS storage maintenance
    :uid: nfs-storage-maintenance-20190501
