Documentation
=============

It's time to get your feet wet and learn how to use GenomeDK! The documentation
is organized such that it can be used in two ways:

* You can read it from beginning to end like a *book* to familiarize yourself
  with GenomeDK and learn how to do basic things like submitting a job and
  working with projects.

* You can use it as a *reference* to look up the solution for specific
  questions you may have, such as what is the command for requesting a new
  project folder? Or, how do I get passwordless authentication working?

If you're new to GenomeDK you will most likely want to read the documentation
*as a book*. As you become more experienced you will more often use it as a
*reference*.

.. rubric:: Overview

Sometimes you need to share files with collaborators or services that do not
have access to GenomeDK. This section describes how to do so with our
data shares.
