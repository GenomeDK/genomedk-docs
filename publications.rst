We provide GenomeDK as a resource to research. If you publish results from
computations performed on GenomeDK, it is important that you acknowledge and/or
cite GenomeDK in your publications. We recommend phrasing it like this:

  *Some/all of the computing for this project was performed on the GenomeDK
  cluster. We would like to thank GenomeDK and Aarhus University for providing
  computational resources and support that contributed to these research
  results.*

This lists known publications where GenomeDK was used for some or all of the
data analysis. The list is updated approximately once a year. If you think a
publication is missing or should not have been included, please let us know.
