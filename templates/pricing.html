                <p>
                    We are open to account requests from people associated with a university, the
                    public sector (government agencies, regions, and municipalities), and small and
                    medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
                </p>

            <h1>How do I pay?</h1>
                <p>Costs are associated with <em>project folders</em>. The owner of a project folder is
                    responsible for the costs associated with the project. The project owner will
                    be charged yearly (in January) based on actual usage.</p>
                <p>If the project owner is associated with either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faculty of Health, Aarhus University,</li>
                    <li>Faculty of Natural Sciences, Aarhus University,</li>
                    <li>Central Region Denmark (Region Midt),</li>
                </ul>
                <p>then the usage is paid internally and the project owner will not receive a bill
                    directly from GenomeDK.</p>
