            <h1>Who can get an account?</h1>

            <p>
                We are open to account requests from people associated with a university, the
                public sector (government agencies, regions, and municipalities), and small and
                medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
            </p>

            <h1>How do I pay?</h1>
                <p>If the project owner is associated with either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faculty of Health, Aarhus University,</li>
                    <li>Faculty of Natural Sciences, Aarhus University,</li>
                    <li>Central Region Denmark (Region Midt),</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                then the usage is paid internally and the project owner will not
                receive a bill directly from GenomeDK.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all other cases, the project owner is charged yearly (in
                December) based on actual usage and the listed prices, unless
                some other agreement has been made.
            </p>

            <h1>How is my bill calculated?</h1>

            <p>Users and project folders are always free of charge and can be requested as needed.
                You are only billed for based on usage of CPU, GPU, storage, and backup.</p>

            <p>One billing hour corresponds to one CPU core for one hour or 8 GB memory for
                one hour, whichever is highest.</p>

            <p>One GPU-hour corresponds to using one GPU for one hour. GPU hours are
                converted to billing hours using the ratio between the CPU price and the GPU price.
                For example, one Nvidia L40S GPU-hour will be counted as (6.00 / 0.13) = 46.15
                billing hours.</p>

            <p>Billing hours are summed on a monthly basis and multiplied by the price per billing hour.</p>

            <p>Storage and backup usage is measured regularly. The last measurement of each month is used for billing and is multiplied by the price/TB/month (for example, 250 / 12).
                </p>

            <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If you store 1 TB of data in backup for a three months, you will be
                billed (250 DKK/TB/year + 500 DKK/TB/year) / 12 months/year * 3 months) = 187.5 DKK.</p>

            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> If you store 1 TB of data for three monts, but only put it in backup in one of the months, you will be
                billed (250 DKK/TB/year / 12 months/year * 3 months) + (500 DKK/TB/year / 12 months/year * 1 month) = 104.16 DKK.</p>
