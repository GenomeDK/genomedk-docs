Newsletter, summer 2022
=======================

Hello!

Summer is upon us and so it is time for yet another newsletter from your
favourite HPC facility.

The past 12 months there's been submitted 15.7 mio. jobs that used a total of 30
mio. billing hours. At the moment we have 625 active users.

News
====

* Many of you need to share data with collaborators, students, and services that
  do not have access to GenomeDK. To facilitate this we have launched
  `data shares <https://genome.au.dk/docs/sharing-data/>`_, a service for easily
  sharing data from GenomeDK.

  To receive data from outside of GenomeDK, you will still have to contact us
  to get a special upload user. However, we plan to integrate this into data
  shares in the future.

* We've introduced a new, unified user request form that makes it easier (and,
  we think, prettier!) to request a new user on GenomeDK. The new form is
  `here <https://console.genome.au.dk/user-requests/create/>`_.

  The new form also makes the user registration process more secure, as users
  can now specify their password directly. This means that we don't have to send
  a password in cleartext to new users by mail.

* There's a new `status page <https://console.genome.au.dk/status/>`_ which
  makes it easy to see if there are any service interruptions or planned
  downtimes.

Hardware
========

* Many of the compute nodes known as *s04* are now retired. During 2022 we will
  continue to retire these machines. New compute nodes will be acquired in 2023.
* We are currently working on the tender for a replacement for ``/faststorage``.
  We expect the migration to happen primo 2023.

Outreach and training
=====================

* If you don't already, remember to follow us
  `on Twitter <https://twitter.com/GenomeDK_AU>`_. If you tweet about your
  work on GenomeDK, tag us and we'll retweet!

* We are open to workshop requests. Read more about your `training offers and
  see a list of previous workshops <https://genome.au.dk/training/>`_.
  Also, please help us spread the word at your institute/center, so that more
  people can benefit from GenomeDK and our training services.
