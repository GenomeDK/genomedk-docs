GenomeDK was founded in 2012 by Professor Anders Børglum and Professor Mikkel
Schierup to analyze the vast amounts of data used for the iPSYCH and
GenomeDenmark projects. Since then GenomeDK has become an essential resource
for students, researchers, and small-to-medium-sized enterprises. We have users
from most regions of Denmark and a wide range of universities.

The Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Faculty of Health, and Central Region
Denmark established the Aarhus Genome Data Center to govern GenomeDK and
ensure its continued success. The leader forum has representatives from all
three parties and is headed by Professor Anders Børglum.

Day-to-day operations are managed by the *technical steering committee*, which
refers to the center board.
